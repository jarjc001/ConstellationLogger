# ConstellationLogger
6th Assessment for Wiley Edge Java course
Will create a web-based application using tools and skills learned throughout the course and present the project to the rest of the class when the project is complete.


I will create a Constellations logger web app. It will:
•	Able to search and filter Constellations based on Month and Latitude from a database of Constellations
•	Able to Create, Modify and view Logs of Constellations
•	Have multiple users that can only access their Logs




Requirements

The completed project will demonstrate your ability to plan and write code effectively. As such, it must meet the following standards:

The code must be well-organized, using a MVC approach.

    Use flowcharts and/or UML diagrams to organize code.
    Use wireframes to plan out your GUI interface.
    The code must be organized in an object-oriented style.
    Use proper naming conventions consistently for all variables in the app.
    Be sure that each layer communicates with other layers appropriately.

The application must include functional unit testing for each part of the application.

    The application must include testing for all CRUD operations.
    Implement testing using JUnit 5 or another Java testing suite.

The application must demonstrate the appropriate use of error handling.

    The application must include custom error messages and implement them where appropriate.
    Error handlers must be in the appropriate packages.

The application must use Spring tools to build and organize the code.

    Use Spring DI and appropriate @Annotations in the code.

The application must include a database.

    If you are using a relational database, such as MySQL:
        Use an ERD to describe the database.
        The database must use appropriate tables and fields.
        The database must be normalized to at least 2NF; 3NF preferred.
        Create and submit a schema .sql file to create the database and a data .sql file to add data to the database.

    If you are using a non-relational database, such as MongoDB:
        Provide documentation that describes the type of data included in the database.
        Include a JSON file with examples of the data included in the database.

The application must use JDBCTemplate or JPA to perform CRUD operations on data using appropriate REST API endpoints.

    At a minimum, the application must include endpoints to Create, Read all, Read by Id, Update by Id, and Delete by Id.
    Include server data validation before writing data to the database.
    Other endpoints may be needed based on the goal of the application.

The application must use a version control system for code.

    At a minimum, Git must be used to manage files locally.


Project Deliverables
Files

A complete submission will include:

    All required code files
    Database scripts
    Planning and documentation files, including flowcharts, UMLs, and ERDs

Presentation

You will deliver a presentation to the course as a whole.

    The presentation should be 10–15 minutes long.
    The presentation should include at minimum:
        An introduction to the project 
            This should be a high-level description that describes the problem the application solves or addresses.
        A description of the application's organization, using ERDs, UMLs, flowcharts, and other appropriate documentation
        Information about the technology stacks used in the project
        Demonstrate how the application works, especially the CRUD functionality, login utility, and any other features you want to highlight.
        Lessons learned
            Describe problems you encountered and how you overcame them.
            What would you do differently next time?

Comments: Unique idea and implementation. Data marshalling component displays student's ability to do the unsung work that is needed in projects from time to time. Well implemented and meets all remit requirements and more. Great work.

I have no intention to use this project for any commercial use and I will not profit in any way from it. Pictures were added after assessment was handed in and marked.
