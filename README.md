Comments: Unique idea and implementation. Data marshalling component displays student's ability to do the unsung work that is needed in projects from time to time. Well implemented and meets all remit requirements and more. Great work.

I have no intention to use this project for any commercial use and I will not profit in any way from it. Pictures were added after assessment was handed in and marked.
